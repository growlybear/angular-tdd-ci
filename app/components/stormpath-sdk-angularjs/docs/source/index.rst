This guide will show you how to crate an AngularJS application that uses the Stormpath
User Management Service to handle user registration and login.  We will show you how to:

* Begin an AngularJS application from scratch, using Grunt, Yeomon and Bower
* Create a simple REST API and secure it with Oauth Access Tokens (JWTs)
* Control access to views in the AngularJS application
* Fetch information about the user from your API
* Render your UI based on the current user sate
